????: Randolph Carter.
????: You have come to see the Great Ones, whom it is unlawful for men to see. 
????: Watchers have spoken of this thing, and the Other Gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void, where broods the daemon-sultan whose name no lips dare speak aloud.

~ lamp

~ acolyte_remains
Blood-stained clothes. All that remains of a willing participant in a ritual sacrifice.

This is not the time to retreat. The journey to this place has been long and hard, and it's time to face the gods.

There is a curious glyph on the chalice. It seems to be pulsing with some sort of energy.

Touch the glyph?

	do DialogueService.add_response("yes")
	You lean forward and touch the glyph.
