Don't worry, we'll get there in the morning.
But it's not safe to travel at night around here."

I'll check the surroundings, just in case.
Better safe than sorry, right?"

We should stop for the day."

I guess that's okay. I'll build the fire. I've gotten used to it."

A person, here? Hey, are you okay?"

You're finally awake!
Don't know how you got in that cave, but 
you don't seem to have a single scratch.

W-where am I? Who are you?

We're close to the place we found you.
We're traveling through this desert..
Some sightseers and I, Hadi, as their guide."

Tell me, what's your name, kid?"

I'm..."

arden_name.
I don't really remember much else...
Where is this desert?"

Well, it's not strange to forget things in here...
You're in a dream, kid."

You'll probably remember everything when you 
wake up. And probably forget about this, too."

A dream? 
Am I dreaming you then?
How do I wake up?

Ha! Lots of questions, kid!
A good sign, if you ask me."

No, I'm not a character in your head.
We're close to the Dreamlands,
so all of us are real, as far as I can tell.
It's a sort of a shared dream, If you may."
},
17: {
"links": {
},
"text": "[Hadi]
As for waking up, just focus on the fact
you're dreaming.
Closing your eyes and shaking a bit helps."

That's weird. Maybe you're physically here.
But then you wouldn't be forgetting things..."

Well, you can stay with us while you figure
things out.. "

We can still go. We're almost at the temple, right?"
