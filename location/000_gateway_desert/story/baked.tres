But it's not safe to travel at night around here."

Better safe than sorry, right?"

We should stop for the day."

Don't know how you got in that cave, but you don't seem to have a single scratch.
And you seem equipped to defend yourself."

W-where am I? Who are you?

We're traveling through this desert: some sightseers and I, Hadi, as their guide."

I'm..."

I don't really remember much else...
Where is this desert?"

You're in a dream!"

A dream? 
Am I dreaming you then?
How do I wake up? "

A good sign, if you ask me."

We're close to the Dreamlands, so all of us are real, as far as I can tell.
It's a sort of a shared dream, If you may."
},
12: {
"links": {
},
"text": "As for waking up, just focus on the fact
you're dreaming.
Closing your eyes and shaking a bit helps."

... Not working, Hadi."

But then you wouldn't be forgetting things..."
