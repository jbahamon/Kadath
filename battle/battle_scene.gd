extends Node

# The Battle Scene should handle initialization: this is, connecting characters
# to the loop, and handling restoring everything to its normal state once the 
# battle has finished

# Declare member variables here. Examples:
# var a = 2
# var b = "text"
var loop: BattleLoop

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	pass # Replace with function body.


func initialize():
	# initialize turn queue from party and encounter
