# DreamQuest: To Unknown Kadath

A 2D Eastern-styled RPG built in Godot, loosely inspired by Lovecraft's "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath".

## About

I like horror books. I was reading the aforementioned "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath" and thought "wow, this reads like a fetch quest", "wow, this feels like someone joined the party" and so on. And having played a number of Eastern-styled RPGs I naturally started to assign mechanics, skills and such to the characters in the story. I had some experience with Godot at the time and thought: "Wait, I *can* make this into a game!". Yes, Lovecraft is a problematic character, but since his works are now public domain, why not reclaiming them? Maybe we can even use them to send a different, better message. 

## Status

In development! Proof-of-concept release available (v0.0.1).

- Dialogue system (via [Dialogue Manager](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager))
